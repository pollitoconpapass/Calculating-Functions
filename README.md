# Calculating-Functions
This is a solution of a Kata in Codewars

- There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
- There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, divided_by
- Each calculation consists of exactly one operation and two numbers
- The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
- Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:

seven(times(five())) # must return 35
